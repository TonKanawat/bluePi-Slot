-- bluePi Slot — 0020 the admin can register any address
--
-- The original rule limited accounts to @bluepi.co.th, enforced by a check
-- constraint on slot.app_user. M has changed that rule: the system admin decides
-- who plays, and the address can be from any domain.
--
-- The domain test goes; the two guarantees that other code actually relies on stay:
--
--   * lower case, because slot.claim_account() matches auth.email() against this
--     column exactly. Mixed case here would lock a real person out of their account.
--   * a shape that is recognisably an address, so a typo like "bob" or "bob@" is
--     refused at the door rather than becoming an account nobody can ever sign in to.
--
-- Registration stays invite-only: only an admin can call slot.register_email(), and
-- signing in with an unregistered address is still refused without saying why.

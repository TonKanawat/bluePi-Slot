-- bluePi Slot — 0008
-- Three decisions from M: the Play Dashboard is public, the game refuses to run
-- until it has been configured, and the master account is seeded.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- public dashboard
-- Every signed-in user can now see every bet and every admin wallet edit.
-- Note the side effect: slot.ledger carries free_after / points_after, so this also
-- exposes each player's running balance to everyone. If that is more than intended,
-- swap this policy for a view that selects only the deltas.
drop policy if exists ledger_read on slot.ledger;
create policy ledger_read on slot.ledger for select
  using (slot.current_user_id() is not null);

-- A friendly shape for the Play Dashboard tab: who, what, how much, when.
